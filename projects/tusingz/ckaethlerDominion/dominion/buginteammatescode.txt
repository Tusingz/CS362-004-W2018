Bugs in Teammates Code:

These errors where all found by running my tests:

Discard function doesn't work correctly
	I found this out by running my unit test and the discard function seems to not discard cards correctly
The sea_hag in turn doesn't correctly discard the right amount of cards from the player
	This was found by running my fourth card test.

The village gives the correct amount of cards to the player but it gives the player 1 too many actions.

The adventurer draws 3 treasure cards instead of 2.
